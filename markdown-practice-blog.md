My Favorite Vacation Destination 
-------------

_October 12, 2021_

My favorite vacation destination is the island of [Lana'i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanai). Nestled between Maui and Moloka'i, most people arrive to the island via a one hour ferry trip from Maui. While much of the island's tourism is relegated to the beautiful Hulopo'e Beach next to the harbor and the Four Seasons, I come to the island for things that are a bit more wild and rugged than a super swanky hotel and a white sand beach.

### My favorite things to do on Lana'i:

- Hunt
- Fish from the harbor
- Spearfish
- Visit the Lana'i Cat Sanctuary
